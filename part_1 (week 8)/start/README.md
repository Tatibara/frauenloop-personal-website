## Plan for Week Eight

* Create an empty project with CRA and add it into your GitHub repo
* Install React Developer Tools
* Create pages with reusable components like: 
  * 5 component pages: HomePage, AboutPage, BlogPage, BlogDetailPage, NotFoundPage
  * 4 components: Header, Footer, Menu, BlogEntry
* Go through the documentation for React Router
* Install React-Router library and connect all pages and components without using of Hooks (we will refactor it to Hooks in the next session).
* Introduction into HOC
