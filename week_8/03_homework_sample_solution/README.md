## Homework

* Create `NotFoundPage` ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/no-match))
* Create `BlogDetailPage`, the link to it can be  `/blog/:id` ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/url-params))
  * For each Entry in BlogPage create a link “Read more” ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link))
  * This link should navigate to `BlogDetailPage` where you can see details for this particular blog entry. (use match props for it [help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match))
  * Change `Link` to `NavLink` in the header and make the active link bold ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink))
  * For exercise purpose only create links:
    * “Back to Blog” - this link should be made with object history ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history))
    * “Back to About” - this should be a new sub-component of this page, use object history as well. ([help](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/withRouter))
    * “Back to Home” - your choice :)
* Read an introduction into [HOC](https://medium.com/@soorajchandran/introduction-to-higher-order-components-hoc-in-react-383c9343a3aa). It is related to the withRouter function.
* You are free to search for some other [tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hitchhikers-guide-to-react-router-v4-4b12e369d10/) on the web.
